# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an AI Engineer with strong Python and Go backend experience, focused on building tools that empower developers through open-source contributions. My passion lies in crafting foundational pipelines and systems from scratch, enabling efficient and reliable AI solutions.

## Focus Areas
### AI and LLM Infrastructure
- Building foundational infrastructure to support the deployment and scalability of Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Creating and refining end-to-end pipelines for integrating LLMs into production environments.
- Developing systems for real-time inference, model versioning, and monitoring.
- Optimizing resource utilization for LLM-based services in cloud and hybrid environments.
- Designing document management systems tailored for LLM workflows, including storage, retrieval, and efficient indexing.

## Key Strengths
- Strong foundation in Python and DevOps tools for AI applications.
- Expertise in designing pipelines and systems from the ground up.
- Practical approach to operationalizing AI with a focus on performance and cost efficiency.

## Supporting Skills
### Authentication & Security
- Expertise in designing secure systems using hashing, JWT, HMAC, and RSA.
- Implemented app integrity measures to ensure secure operations and prevent unauthorized access.
- Familiar with integrating social authentication services.

### DevOps Practices
- Extensive experience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration for deploying AI solutions.
- Proficient in AWS and GCP for scalable cloud-based LLM infrastructure.
- Skilled in automation and infrastructure-as-code using Terraform for deployment consistency.

## Representative Projects
