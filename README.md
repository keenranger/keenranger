# Hi 👋

Building AI agents that actually work.

Currently @ **Asleep** — shipping AI-powered sleep products to real users.

## What I'm working on

**B2C & D2C products** — not just demos, actual products people use
- Sleep analysis apps in production
- SleepHub: device-to-customer, AI meets hardware
- Voice agents that talk to real customers

**Agent infrastructure** — making AI agents effective at scale
- Internal skill libraries that agents can actually use
- Multi-agent orchestration for production workloads
- End-to-end: LLM pipelines → backend → cloud infra

## What I care about

- **Ship > polish** — learn from real users, not hypotheticals
- **Agents as teammates** — not just tools, actual collaborators
- **Infra that disappears** — good systems feel invisible

## Currently exploring

- Personal AI agents (yes, I have one)
- A2A protocols and multi-agent collaboration
- The gap between agent demos and agent products
