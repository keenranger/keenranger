# Hi there 👋

I'm an AI/Agent engineer focused on building intelligent systems powered by large language models. With a strong backend foundation in Python and Go, I design autonomous AI agents from infrastructure to user interaction, delivering real-time, personalized experiences.

### What I do  
- Architect end-to-end pipelines for LLM-based agent systems, including routing, memory, and decision logic  
- Build production-ready AI agents like SleepMind and Z톡, integrated with messengers like Slack and KakaoTalk  
- Develop secure, scalable cloud infrastructure using Docker, AWS Fargate, and Terraform  
- Create internal tools like the user insight engine to extract, store, and utilize user context over time  
- Focus on fast iteration, live testing, and monitoring to keep agents responsive and reliable

### My strengths  
- Deep understanding of both LLM capabilities and backend infrastructure to operationalize agents effectively  
- Passionate about multi-agent systems, prompt engineering, and long-term memory integration  
- Practical, speed-oriented builder who favors clean abstractions and real-world impact

### Looking ahead  
I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of what AI agents can do — from daily copilots to autonomous services. I explore emerging techniques in agent orchestration, open-source tooling, and user-personalized AI to stay ahead in this rapidly evolving space.
